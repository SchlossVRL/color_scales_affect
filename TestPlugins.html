                        "  <br>If you decide to participate in this research you may be first asked to complete a standard visual acuity or color vision test.  If administered, the tests will examine your perceptual functions (e.g. color vision, and/or depth perception). You may participate in the tasks regardless of the outcome of these tests."+
                        "  <br><br>You will then be asked to partake in a task from at least one of the following three categories: (1) computer/paper tasks, (2) touch tasks, (3) virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) tasks." +
                        "  <br><br>In computer/paper based tasks you will be presented with visual displays containing images and/or text and will be asked to make judgments about them. For example, you may see shapes and be asked how round they appear or view a graph with a legend and interpret information about the data in the graph. You may also be asked questions about information on a particular topic related to the experiment (e.g., the visual or auditory system). You will be asked to respond by making button presses on a keyboard/mouse, marks on paper, or voiced sounds. The study team may record your voice. This recording will not contain identifiable information, and will be kept for future research. Sometimes you may hear sounds (beeps or music) played at a comfortable volume though headphones or speakers. For example, you may here a tone that signals the start of the next trial. You may be asked to complete questionnaires about your expertise or educational level in a given domain (e.g., neuroscience) and questionnaires about what sorts of things you like/dislike." +
                        "  <br><br>Finally, you may be asked to respond to questions about your experience during the experiment (e.g., how much you enjoyed the task). In touch tasks, you will be asked to complete similar tasks as described for the computer/paper tasks, but rather than viewing visual displays, you will be asked to make judgments after touching textures with your hands. In VR/AR tasks you will be asked to explore virtual or augmented environments either in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery (WID) Virtual Reality CAVE or wearing a head-mounted display (HMD), such as the Oculus Rift. The CAVE is a 6-sided 100x100x100 room. You will be able to experience 3D models of virtual environments by wearing 3D glasses that are coordinated computer with projections of images on all sides of the CAVE. You will be asked to spend up to three 15 minute sessions in the virtual or augmented environment. While in the environment, you will be asked to explore the space and make judgments about what you see. You will be asked to respond by pressing buttons on a hand-held control." +

                        "  <br>If you participate in a task that involves Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality (VR/AR) either in the CAVE or using head mounted displays (HMDs) there is a chance that you may experience mild symptoms similar to motion sickness including dizziness, headaches, eye strain, or nausea. Most often, these symptoms resolve quickly, but in some cases they may last several hours before completely subsiding. The CAVE is an enclosed environment and it is possible you might experience feelings associated with claustrophobia. The experimenter will be positioned right outside the testing area at all times and will assist you if necessary. You can take breaks if you need to and you can end the experiment at any time if you feel uncomfortable." +

At the end of the semester, those extra credit points are converted such that 1 point of extra credit = 0.33% added directly to your grade at the end of term.

In such cases, the data will not be linked to your name or other identifiable information." +
